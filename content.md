#Projects you can make

Below are three projects you can choose from. Each project will allow you to practice some of the skills you've learned so far.

## Bucket List
Create and share a list of things you've done and things you want to do. For this project, you'll use markdown, an easy-to-read and easy-to-write format that allows you to create web content without writing html. 

It will look something like this:

To edit the bucket list and add your own items:
 1. Go to your fork of this repo
 2. Navigate to bucket-list -> my-list.md 
 3. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
 4. Use this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to add more elements to your Bucket List, such as bold, italics, or images.

## Resume
Modify a sample resume with your own contact information, education and work experience, and skills. For this project, you'll edit an html file. It will look something like this:

## Business Front Page
Create your own page promoting your business. For this project, you'll edit an html file. It will look something like this:
