## Bucket List
Create a share a list of things you've done and things you want to do. For this project, you'll use markdown, an easy-to-read and easy-to-write format that allows you to create web content without writing html. 

Use this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to add more elements to your Bucket List, such as bold, italics, or images.
